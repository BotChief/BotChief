BotChief — Automate Your Web Tasks with Ease
Welcome to the official BotChief repository.
BotChief is our in-house developed web automation tool designed for advanced and flexible browser automation. Whether you need to automate account creation, data scraping, social media marketing, or custom repetitive web tasks, BotChief gives you the full control.

🚀 What is BotChief?
BotChief is a powerful no-code/low-code web automation builder that lets you:

Create custom bots for any website without writing complex code

Use built-in modules to simulate human behavior

Integrate anti-fingerprint browser technology for safe multi-account operations

Automate crypto marketing, e-commerce workflows, and social media growth

Unlike generic bots, BotChief combines a visual workflow editor with a scripting core. You own the scripts — you control the automation.

🔍 Why Does BotChief Matter?
Automation and privacy protection are growing concerns for marketers, crypto users, and growth hackers. Many public bots fail because they are easy to detect or too rigid to adapt. BotChief solves this with:

A custom fingerprint browser that bypasses basic bot detection

A modular design that works with any site structure

Developer-friendly features for advanced automation logic
